# Examples of multiline prompts in YAML
# All of these formats are supported by gemini-cli

# 1. Simple quoted multiline string
- "This is a multiline prompt
  that spans multiple lines
  within double quotes"

# 2. Literal block scalar (preserves exact formatting)
- |
  This is a literal block scalar
  that preserves newlines exactly
  as they appear in the YAML file.
  
  It can have multiple paragraphs
  and preserve all whitespace.

# 3. Folded block scalar (folds newlines to spaces)
- >
  This is a folded block scalar
  that folds newlines to spaces
  but preserves paragraph breaks.

# 4. Multiline with explicit escape sequences
- "This prompt uses \n explicit line breaks \n within quoted strings"

# 5. Complex multiline with code blocks
- |
  Write a Python function that:
  
  1. Takes a list of numbers as input
  2. Returns the sum of all even numbers
  3. Handles edge cases like empty lists
  
  Example usage:
  ```python
  result = sum_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  print(result)  # Should output: 6
  ```

# 6. Multiline with bullet points
